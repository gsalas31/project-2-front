## Code Snippet
const response = await fetch(`${URL}/quotes/${event.target.dataset.quoteid}`, {
     method: "delete"
     })

    - Dataset was something new I learned while elaborating this project. I dont have an specific favorite but I enjoyed entering data. 

## Issues and Resolutions

I will say DATA !!! It is actually fun to see how everything populates but I had to delete and seed so many times. But, don't get me wrong this made me feel more comfortable while using data.
